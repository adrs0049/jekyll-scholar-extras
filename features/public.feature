Feature: Public or Not
  A BibTeX bibliography may contain publications that are not supposed to be public as of yet.
  This could be due to several reasons such as it being under submission. 
  In order to allow this, I have a specific field that can be inserted in the BibTeX to describe whether a particular entry should be generated using jekyll-scholar or not.
